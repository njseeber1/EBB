DESCRIPTION
===========

This is a SquirrelMail plugin to allow users to change their own POP account 
password using the CPanel web hosting control panel mechanism. 

It also allows an existing "web protected" (htaccess) folder to be synched 
up with the new password. (The protected folder must already by configured 
using the CPanel web protection utility and it must use the same username 
as the email account.)

WARNING
===========

This plugin ONLY works for "additional" POP email accounts that have been
created through CPanel. It will NOT work with the "main" CPanel POP account. 
(In other words, it will only work with POP accounts that use the full
"username@domain.com" naming convention.)

REQUIREMENTS
===========

1)  The "compatibility" plugin is required.
    (http://www.squirrelmail.org/plugin_view.php?id=152)
2) A web hosting account that uses the CPanel control panel.
