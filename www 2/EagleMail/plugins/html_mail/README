HTML Mail plugin for SquirrelMail
=================================
Ver 2.0, 11/09/03

Original Author: Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynerds.com>
Derived From: htmlArea WYSIWYG editor from interactivetools.com
              Enhanced Text Area Plugin by Chris Franklin
              Emoticons Plugin by Pablo Macouzet Jr.



Description
===========

This plugin allows users with IE 5.5 and Mozilla 1.4 and 
above to compose and send their email in HTML format.

A selection of emoticons are available as an optional
feature.  Note that these emoticon images will be served
from your web server when message recipients read their
mail.  Also note that when adding emoticons, the user 
should be sure to click in the textarea for correct focus.

Also, an integrated spell checker is available.  You must
turn it on in the configuration file, and make sure that
your server is ready to support this functionality (see
below).  

This plugin requires a minor patch to the SquirrelMail source
only if you do not have SquirrelMail 1.4.2 or if you want to 
use the emoticons functionality.

Note that this plugin can be quirky, especially in combination
with other plugins, etc.  This is due to the beta nature of 
the renderer as well as the fact that everything is javascript
based and can thus intimidate some browsers (so to speak).



Spell Check Configuration
=========================

You must have a Perl interpreter available with these modules
installed:

  - CGI
  - Encode
  - HTML::Parser
  - HTML::Entities
  - Text::Aspell

If you have a recent version of Perl (such as 5.8), Text::Aspell
might be the only one of these you don't already have.  Of course,
CPAN.org is helpful in obtaining and installing Perl modules.  An
example of how to get Text::Aspell is as such:

perl -MCPAN -e'CPAN::Shell->install("Text::Aspell")'

You must also make sure your web server is configured to allow
the execution of CGI scripts at least in the spell checker
directory.  For apache, an appropriate directive might look
like:

<Directory /path/to/squirrelmail/plugins/html_mail/htmlarea/plugins/SpellChecker>
  Options +ExecCGI
  AddHandler cgi-script cgi
</Directory>

Note that if you symlink multiple virtual domains to one SquirrelMail
installation, you may need to repeat this directive for each domain,
or alternatively, you can place these directives in a .htaccess file 
in the spell checker directory (given in the above example).  If you
choose the latter, note that your AllowOverride directive would need 
to include the Options directive type.

And, of course, you have to turn on the spell checker in the
html_mail configuration file!
