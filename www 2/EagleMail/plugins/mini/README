Mini SquirrelMail plugin

------------------------

by Jason Munro

  The mini SquirrelMail plugin is an addition to SquirrelMail
that gives you a miniture window in which to keep track of new
mail and to even read text messages (no html or attachement
handling). The plugin is simple to use. After installation you
will have a 'mini window' link at the top of your folder list.
This will spawn a javascript window that displays any folder
that has new mail and it's current mail count. The folders can be
expanded to show you the subject and sender. Clicking on the subject
will open the message within the mini window if it has an easy to
locate text part. More complicated multipart messages will not
open and the plugin will tell you that you must open them up in
the main SquirrelMail window.

There are several options available in:

Options->Display preferences 

The options are : window width in pixels
                  window height in pixels
                  refresh frequency
                  text size

This plugin is known to work with the following software:

PHP versions: 4.1.2, 4.2.2, 4.2.3

SquirrelMail versions: 1.3.2 CVS + 1.2.9 CVS 
                       1.3.1 
                       1.2.8 (rg=0 or 1)
                       1.2.7 -> 1.2.4

browsers: Netscape (4.77, 6, 7)
          Internet Explorer (5.5, 6)
          Mozilla (1.0, 1.1)
          Galeon (1.2.5, 1.2.6)

It uses very little Javascript and will probably work with almost any setup
that SquirrelMail works with

Thanks to Jonathan Angliss for all the suggestions, testing, and 
troubleshooting.
