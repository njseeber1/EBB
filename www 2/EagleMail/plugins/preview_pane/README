Preview Pane plugin for SquirrelMail
====================================
Ver 1.1, 7/03/04

Original author: Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynerds.com>


Description
===========

This plugin allows the user to turn on an extra frame below
the mailbox message list where the messages themselves are 
displayed, very similar to many other popular (typically
non-web-based) email clients.

Note that users must turn this functionality on by going to
the Options-->Display Preferences menu.  

While this plugin has been tested thoroughly, there may be
some functionalities and/or plugins that don't quite work 
when the preview pane is turned on, since SquirrelMail was 
not designed with this type of layout in mind.  Future versions
of SquirrelMail will have its presentation layer abstracted
to a larger degree, at which time any anomalies you may 
experience with this plugin will probably go away.  But for
the most part, this plugin should be very solid.

Feel free to report any anomalous behavior to the SquirrelMail
Plugins mailing list.  

Also note that this plugin was meant to work with SquirrelMail
versions 1.4.3 and 1.5.1.  It will work with 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 
1.5.0, and probably 1.4.0, however, it requires several code
updates that are currently only in 1.4.3 and 1.5.1.  

Finally, for users of the Sent Confirmation plugin, you should
download the newest version (1.6) of Sent Confirmation that was 
designed to work more seamlessly with Preview Pane.
