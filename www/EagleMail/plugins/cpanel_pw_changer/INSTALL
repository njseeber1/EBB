Installing the CPanel Password Changer Plugin
=======================

1) Start with unarchiving (untaring) the file into the SM plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of this plugin.

	$ cd plugins
	$ tar -zxvf cpanel_pw_changer-1.0-1.0.0.tar.gz

2) Change into the cpanel_pw_changer directory, copy the config.php.sample
   file as a new file called config.php and then edit the settings in the file.

	$ cd change_passwd
	$ cp config.php.sample config.php
	$ vi config.php

5) Go to the SM config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose option 8 and move 
   the plugin from the "Available Plugins" category to the "Installed Plugins"
   category.  Save and exit.

	$ cd ../../config/
	$ ./conf.pl

   -or-

   Upload the cpanel_pw_changer folder and files into the plugins folder
   of your SM location. Modify the main SM config.php file and add the
   cpanel_pw_changer as a new plugin.

6) Verify that you have the "compatibility" plugin installed.  (It is 
   required.)



Upgrading the CPanel Password Changer Plugin
===============================

1) Start with unarchiving (untaring) the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the plugin.

	$ cd plugins
	$ tar -zxvf cpanel_pw_changer-1.0-1.0.0.tar.gz


2) Change into the cpanel_pw_changer directory.  Check your config.php 
   file against the new version to see if there are any new settings
   that you must add to your existing config.php file.

	$ diff -Nau config.php config.php.sample

   -or- 
   
   Replace your existing config.php file with the provided sample
   and then reconfigure the plugin from scratch. (See step 2 under the
   installation procedure above.)
