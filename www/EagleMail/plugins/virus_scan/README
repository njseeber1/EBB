    Program ........ Virus Scan
    Version ........ 0.5
    Purpose ........ Allows an admin to scan any types of attachments for known
                     Mass Mailing Viruses

*******************************************************************************/

   REQUIRES : Squirrlemail v1.4.0 or higher


Features
========

   * Simplistic Virus Scanning ability (with over 130 signatures of
     common Mass Mail viruses)
   * Blocks users from downloading infected files
     (except excludes users, just warns)
   * A warning is displayed when the user tries to download the file
   * Users can be excluded by username
   * Can Auto-Update virus definitions, checks every 24 hours for updates
   * RG = 0 Compatible
   * E_ALL Compatible
   * Faster loading SM Compatible
   * SM Version checking Compatible


Installation
============

   As with other plugins, just uncompress the archive in the plugins
   directory, go back to the main directory, run configure and add the plugin.
   Questions/comments/flames/etc can be sent to the jimmy@advcs.org

   plugins/virusscan/includes/virussignatures.php has to be writable by the webserver!
   plugins/virusscan/config.php has to be writable by the webserver!

   To administer the plugin, create a file called "admins" inside of the squirrelmail
   config directory.  Then put your the usernames that are used to log into squirrelmail
   in this file (1 name per line) and leave a few blank lines after the last one.
   Then open Squirrlemail and goto the options panel and click on "Virus Scan"
   (This is a limitation of how the administrator plugin handles the admins file,
   I do it this way to keep compatibility)
   Or just download the Admin Add plugin.

To Do
============

  Faster Scanning engine, possibly perl in order to include all 9000+ virus signatures


Change Log
============
   0.5
      * Major Bug Fix - Unconfigured clients (No write access to virussignatures.php)
           are hammering my server once every 1-60 seconds.
           PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE configure your plugin correctly!!
           
      * Updating Signatures will now not return signatures that will not run on your
           version of VirusScan, this opens up the ability to add new wildcard signatures
           wihout breaking older clients

      * A few small fixes

   0.4
      * Admin Interface - Can now set it to update at every 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, or 48 Hours
      * Admin Interface - Now shows Signatures version and time stamp
      * Admin Interface - Added an "Update Virus Signatures" link to immediately check for updates
      * Admin Interface - Added a "Show Virus Signatures" link to show the current Signature table
      * Admin Interface - Displays last time it checked for an update
      * Changed Updater to default to every 12 hours instead of 24
      * Complete Internationalization (Just need some translators now)
      * Now checks to see if we need to update on login and attachment scan
      * Some code cleanup

   0.3
      * Fixes for wrong file name reporting, E_ALL errors
      * Changes to the virus signatures, now much faster loading
      * Small code improvements
      * Renamed config file to config.php (with code to auto rename it for you)
      * Doesn't scan files above 1 Meg (not likely to be a mass mailing virus)
      * Enabling AutoUpdate immediately checks for an update

   0.2
      * Small fix for when you don't have an admins file in the config directory
        (Which it tells you in the install section that you have to create one)

   0.1
      * Converted to its own plugin (formerly in blocked attachments plugin)
      * Lots of small fixes
      * Admin can click on the number of viruses in admin interface to see all the
        viruses being blocked with a link to each Norton page with info on the virus.
