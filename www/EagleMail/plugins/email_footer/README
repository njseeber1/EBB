Email Footer Plugin
-------------------

This automatically tacks a message onto the end of messages
that as they're being sent from SquirrelMail. It functions
just like the Hotmail/Yahoo/etc. mail services, with all of
their little 'get your own free hoojamajiggy' messages.

Changing the message is a very simple process. There's a
variable called '$enter_your_message_here' in the configuration
file.  Just change the text of the example there.

If you have the "HTML Mail" plugin installed, you may want
to specify a HTML-formatted version of the footer for users
who send their email in HTML.  This is OPTIONAL (the plain
text footer will be used by default), but if you want to 
send a footer in HTML format, change the contents of the 
'$enter_your_message_here_in_HTML' variable in the 
configuration file.

This plugin should work with all versions of SM since
1.0.0. If there are problems please post to the
squirrelmail-plugins mailing list.


ChangeLog
-------------------

0.3 - Updated to work with HTML_Mail plugin, such that
      a separate footer in HTML may be specified, or
      the same plain text footer can be used, and lines 
      won't get concatenated on top of one another when 
      sending HTML-formatted emails

0.2 - Updated to work with SquirrelMail 1.4.2
      Updated for compatibility with new faster plugin design.
      Updated for SquirrelMail version reporting API.
      Moved message configuration to separate file that
      will not be overwritten by subsequent plugin upgrades.

0.1 - Initial release. No known problems, but then again I
    didn't tested it with Konquerer ;)
