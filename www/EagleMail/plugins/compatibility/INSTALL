Installing the Compatibility Plugin
===================================

1) Untar the file into the plugins directory.  Here is a example 
   for the 1.0 version of the compatibility plugin.

      $ cd plugins
      $ tar -zxvf compatibility-1.0.tar.gz

2) You do *NOT* need to enable this plugin using conf.pl, since
   it has no functionality in and of itself.  However, if you
   use the Plugin Updates plugin, you do need to enable this 
   plugin in order to see it on the Plugin Updates page:

   ---------- optional ----------

   Go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose option
   8 and add the compatibility plugin.  Save and exit.

      $ cd ../../config
      $ ./conf.pl

   ---------- optional ----------
