Autocomplete -- Version 2.0

If you hate looking up people from your address book and would rather have
your browser try to perform some sort of autocomplete, this script is for
you.  It only works with IE, since IE is the only browser that lets you
select parts of text in a text-entry form field, but that's at least
something.


Features
========

* Lets you look up just nicknames, nicknames and email, email, or none.
* Since SquirrelMail 1.0.x and 0.x both do not support nicknames only in 
  the To/CC/BCC fields, nickname autocompletion is disabled.
* It even supports multiple names on one line, but you must use a space
  to separate the addresses/nicknames.


Description
===========

Simply use IE 4 or better (and not the Mac version of IE 4) and start to
type in something on the Compose screen.  If you type in the To/CC/BCC
fields, you will notice that autocomplete has tried to fill in the rest of
the name for you.

As a warning, when you are using case insensitive searches and you are 
typing in a foreign address (one not in your address book), this plugin will 
try to complete it for you.  This process might change the case of what you
were typing.  This is the reason the case insensitive searches are disabled
by default.

Future Work
===========

* Maybe find a weird way for Netscape or Opera to do the same?
* Fix case change problem?
* Find cursor position and only search if it is at the end of a name or
  at the end of the text box


Installation
============

As with other plugins, just uncompress the archive in the plugins
directory, go back to the main directory, run configure and add the plugin.

Questions/comments/flames/etc can be sent to the SquirrelMail plugins list.


Changes
=======
2.0 - Now returns addresses in the format "nickname <email@address>"
      or "Full Name <email@address", depending on which option is set.
      Having typed a partial name or nickname, you can use the up and down
      arrow keys to cycle through the entries that match what you have
      typed.
      Compatible with SquirrelMail 1.4 (as well as older versions)
      New setup.php format for better overall SquirrelMail performance.
      Makes use of new Compatibility plugin (this is a requirement).
      Internationalized all plugin output.

1.3 - Updated to work with register_globals = Off
      Updated for compatibility with "Plugin Updates" plugin

1.2 - No longer uses 'undefined' -- IE 5.0 didn't like that.  :-)

1.1 - Felt like making some code changes, removed an update bug
