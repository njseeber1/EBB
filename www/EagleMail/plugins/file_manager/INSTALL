Installing the file_manager Plugin
==================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the file_manager plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf file_manager-1.0-1.2.7.tar.gz

2) Go into the file_manager directory

  $ cd file_manager

3) Copy config.php.sample to config.php and edit config.php,
   making adjustments as you deem necessary.  For more detailed
   explanations about each of these parameters, consult the
   "Configuration" section in the README file.

  $ cp config.php.sample config.php
  $ vi config.php

4) Copy file_manager.users.sample to file_manager.users and
   edit file_manager.users, adding a line for each user that 
   should have file management access.  Remember to set each 
   user's base directory carefully!  For more detailed information 
   on the available settings, see the "Configuration" section 
   in README.

  $ cp file_manager.users.sample file_manager.users
  $ vi file_manager.users

5) NOTE - This step ONLY applies to SquirrelMail versions 1.2.x.
   If you are running 1.4.0 or greater, you should skip to step
   number 6.  
   For older SquirrelMail versions, if you want email attachments 
   from File Manager to work, replace SquirrelMail's compose.php 
   with what is included with File Manager under the "attachment_patch" 
   directory.  Make sure to use the file that corresponds to your 
   SquirrelMail version.

  $ cp attachment_patch/1.2.11/compose.php ../../src/compose.php 
  cp: overwrite `../../src/compose.php'? y 

6) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose 
   option 8 and add the file_manager plugin.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config
  $ ./conf.pl
