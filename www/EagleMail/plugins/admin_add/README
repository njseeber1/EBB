   REQUIRES : Squirrlemail v1.4.0 or higher


Features
========
   Allows you to add and delete admins from the config/admins file
   

Installation
============

   As with other plugins, just uncompress the archive in the plugins
   directory, go back to the main directory, run configure and add the plugin.
   Questions/comments/flames/etc can be sent to the jimmy@advcs.org
   
   To administer the plugin, create a file called "admins" inside of the squirrelmail
   config directory.  Then put your the usernames that are used to log into squirrelmail
   in this file (1 name per line) and leave a few blank lines after the last one.
   Then open Squirrlemail and goto the options panel and click on "Virus Scan"
   (This is a limitation of how the administrator plugin handles the admins file,
    I do it this way to keep compatibility)
    
To Do
============
  Groups (certain admins for certain plugins)
