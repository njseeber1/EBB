Installing Quota Usage
======================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.2 version of the quota_usage plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf quota_usage-1.2.tar.gz

2) Change into the quota_usage directory, copy config.php.sample
   to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as
   you deem necessary.

  $ cd quota_usage
  $ cp config.php.sample config.php
  $ vi config.php

3) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl



Upgrading Quota Usage
=====================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.2 version of the quota_usage plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf quota_usage-1.2.tar.gz


2) Change into the quota_usage directory, check your config.php
   file against the new version, to see if there are any new
   settings that you must add to your config.php file.

  $ diff -Nau config.php config.php.sample

   Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided sample
   and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the
   installation procedure above).
