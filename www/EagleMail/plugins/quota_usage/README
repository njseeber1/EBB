Quota Usage                                                 version 1.1


* ABOUT *

This plugin retrieves the currect quota usage from the IMAP server using the 
IMAP4 QUOTA extension.  Right now, it only parses the STORAGE part.  If you
also have a quota on the number of messages, it won't display it.  I don't use
it, so it'll probably be up to someone else to write it.


* REQUIREMENTS *

- IMAP server with QUOTA Extension support
- Quota set for user.  (if it's not set, nothing is displayed).
    NOTE:  Courier-IMAP may not report the quota if usage is 0%.  Try sending
    a message to the user if this is the case.


I've tested this with Courier-IMAP 1.4.0 and above .  Courier-IMAP only deals 
with maildirquotas, as far as I know.  So it might not work with file system 
quotas.  I use it successfully with Vpopmail 5.1.4 and above, a virtual domain 
package for Qmail.

As of version 0.2, it should work with Cyrus IMAP as well.

Version 1.1 has been verified to work with SquirrelMail 1.4

Version 1.2 has been verified to work with SquirrelMail 1.5


* INSTALL *

Please read the INSTALL file.


* CONFIGURATION *

There are just a few optional configuration items:  

   $fontsize              --  Change this if you want to increase or decrease 
                              the size of the text and bar graph shown
   $warn_percent          --  Change this to match the warning level of your 
                              system.  It turns the bar graph to a red color
                              when a user gets to the specified level
   $yellow_alert_percent  --  Set this to a percentage lower than $warn_percent
                              if you want the graph to turn yellow at the 
                              specified level.  Set to zero or an empty string
                              to disable.                              
   $intro_text            --  This is the text that shows up above the quota 
                              report; change as desired or set it as an empty 
                              string to remove it from the display

These are all found in the config.php file.

Please me send me any enhancements or success stories!


* CREDITS *

Most of the code (for establishing the IMAP stream) is taken directly from
the Filters plugin by Brent Bice.  The rest is just based on examples from the
SquirrelMail source, plus some formatting of the results by me.

Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynerds.com> made the version 1.1 and 1.2 updates.


* TODO *

- None at this point
