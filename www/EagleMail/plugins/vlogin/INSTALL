Installing Vlogin
=================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 3.4 version of the vlogin plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf vlogin-3.4-1.2.7.tar.gz

2) Change into the vlogin/data directory, copy config.php.sample
   to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as 
   you deem necessary.  For more detailed explanations about 
   each of these parameters, consult the README file.

  $ cd vlogin/data
  $ cp config.php.sample config.php
  $ vi config.php


3) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

4) Also, please verify that you have the "compatibility" plugin
   installed.


---------- optional ----------

If you need to change certain settings such as IMAP server, you
will need to download the Multilogin plugin and use the patch
included with it to make one small modification of the SquirrelMail
code.  If you do so, you must also set $useSessionBased = 1 in 
vlogin's config.php file (mentioned above).  

Please note that this is only necessary for settings such as
IMAP server, and most installations will not require this extra
step.

Please read the instructions in the Multilogin INSTALL file for
how to make the change to the SquirrelMail source code (you can
safely ignore all other steps in that INSTALL file, except step
number 1).

Upgrading Vlogin
================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 3.4 version of the vlogin plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf vlogin-3.4-1.2.7.tar.gz


2) Change into the vlogin/data directory, check your config.php
   file against the new version, to see if there are any new 
   settings that you must add to your config.php file.

  $ cd vlogin/data
  $ diff -Nau config.php config.php.sample

   Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided sample
   and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the
   installation procedure above).
