Installing Preview Pane
=======================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the Preview Pane 
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf preview_pane-1.0-1.4.3.tar.gz

2) Patch the SquirrelMail source code to provide better 
   integration with this plugin.  This step is technically
   optional, however, it is strongly recommended, and is a
   very minor patch which can be done by hand if necessary.

   There are two ways to do this:

     A) This is the recommended method, which guarantees you will not
        lose any other changes you may have made to your SquirrelMail
        installation.  Change to the main SquirrelMail directory and
        run the following command to patch your SquirrelMail source 
        code for this plugin:

       $ cd ..
       $ patch -p0 < plugins/preview_pane/patches/preview_pane_squirrelmail-1.4.3.diff

        Note that if you have version 1.5.x, change that last command to use the
        correct .diff file.

        If the output of this command indicates any FAILUREs, you either
        need to update the patch utility on your system or you have some
        non-standard/modified SquirrelMail source code; we can work together
        to get your version patched - just send an email.

        Note for Windows users: you can get native patch functionality
        by installing this very useful package:
        http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

     B) If you are certain you have an unmodified SquirrelMail installation
        or are having problems with the patch command above, you may use the
        provided pre-patched source file by running this command:

       $ cd ..
       $ cp plugins/preview_pane/source_files/read_body.php-squirrelmail-1.4.3 src/read_body.php
       cp: overwrite `src/read_body.php'? y

        Note that if you have version 1.5.x, change that last command to use the
        correct file.

3) If you are also running the Archive Mail plugin, you will need
   to patch or replace one of its files with what is included with this 
   plugin.

   There are two ways to do this (in this case, it might not be as important
   to run the patch as opposed to copying the file):

     A) Change to the archive_mail directory and run the following command 
        to patch that plugin so it works with this one:

       $ cd plugins/archive_mail
       $ patch -p0 < ../preview_pane/patches/preview_pane_archive_mail_squirrelmail_1-4-x.diff

     B) Use the pre-patched file provided with this plugin:

       $ cd plugins/archive_mail
       $ cp ../preview_pane/source_files/archive_mail_bottom.php includes/
       cp: overwrite `includes/archive_mail_bottom.php'? y

4) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl
