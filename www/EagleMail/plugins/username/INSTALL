Installing the Username Plugin
==============================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 2.0 version of the username
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf username-2.0-1.0.0.tar.gz

2) Change into the username directory, copy config.php.sample
   to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as
   you deem necessary (for example, you can change the format 
   of the welcome message that is displayed when the username 
   is placed in the Message Of The Day.  You need to edit the 
   variable $usernameMotdWelcomeMessage in the configuration
   file for this).

  $ cd username
  $ cp config.php.sample config.php
  $ vi config.php

3) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

4) Also, please verify that you have the "compatibility" plugin
   installed.



Upgrading the Username Plugin
=============================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 2.0 version of the username
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf username-2.0-1.0.0.tar.gz

2) Change into the username directory, check your config.php
   file against the new version, to see if there are any new
   settings that you must add to your config.php file.

  $ diff -Nau config.php config.php.sample

   Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided sample
   and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the
   installation procedure above).
