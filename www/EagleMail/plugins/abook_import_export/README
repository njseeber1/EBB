GENERAL USE
===========
1. Sanity checks
	
	There still aren't a lot of sanity checks on the file that you upload. 
	As of right now it will check to see if you uploaded an Outlook file or 
	one that was downloaded from Squirrelmail. It will perform it's upload 
	a little differently from each side. 


Credit where Credit is due. 
===========================

	The original plugin that I made my updates to was Dustin Anders' 
	abook_import_export plugin version 0.6 the Squirrelmail 1.4 version. The
	plugin interface on the Address page is still the same, as well as the 
	address_book_export.php, for the most part. There is one small change to 
	use the hashed directory structure. The majority of my changes went into 
	the address_book_import.php. There is still some of the original code, but 
	not a whole lot. I moved where things are to make it easier to read and 
	to write to.


	I developed and tested this version of the plugin using PHP 4.1.1, Squirrelmail
	1.4.0 and Outlook 2000 as the export file to test with. Please let me know 
	if you find any bugs or issues, as well as enhancements and feature 
	requests.

  Did some "under the cover" work, cleaned up some E_ALL errors, and updated
  the plugin for 1.4+ compatability.
