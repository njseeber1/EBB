Installing the abook_import_export Plugin
==================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 0.1 version of the abie plugin.

    $ cd plugins
    $ tar -xzvf abook_import_export-0.1-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

    $ cd ../config/
    $ ./conf.pl

3) Log into SquirrelMail and goto 'Addresses' and at the bottom
of the page will be the buttons for importing and exporting your
address book.
